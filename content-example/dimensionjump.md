  <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
  <p>
    Dimension Jump is a precision puzzle platformer, where you don't just jump between platforms, you jump between dimensions! <br />
    <br />
    Once you’ve picked up the basics you'll have to master the art of dimension jumping, gravity switching and teleporting to get through some of the most challenging levels on offer. <br />
    <br />
    With over 90 levels to complete, each with challenge times and bonus stars, there will be plenty to challenge all skill levels. As you progress through level sets the difficulty increases, adding in new mechanics and putting all the skills you’ve learned to the test. <br />
    <br />
    Collect Steam achievements by completing level sets and other accomplishments, challenge your friends with your own custom levels using the level editor, and compete against the world on global leaderboards for the fastest times.<br />

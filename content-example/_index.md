  <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
  <p>
      Redpoint is a new form of game development collective - backed by a company structure, we provide
      our members with shared funding for their projects.  We aim to deliver a diverse range of
      digital and physical games. 
  </p>
  <h2 id="history">History</h2><strong>Foundation</strong>
  <p>
      In late 2015, Josh Harvey, June Rhodes and Liam Alkamraikhi formed Redpoint as a new game collective model - one where members earn
      almost all of the revenue generated from their projects, with most of the remainder going into a shared fund that can be used to
      support new projects as they're developed.  We formed a new company under the Redpoint brand and set up the legal structure required
      to support such a model.  We are now testing this revenue and collective model with our own internal projects, before opening
      up applications to a wider group of game developers.
  </p>
  <strong>Dimension Jump</strong>
  <p>
      Our first game released under Redpoint, Dimension Jump is a puzzle precision platformer where players don't just jump between
      platforms, they jump between dimensions.  With bigger games planned in our future, we knew we had to enable ourselves to
      publish on various platforms.  Aiming to deliver an engaging game in less than 8 months, we set out to build upon previous
      IP and deliver Dimension Jump.  Dimension Jump released on Steam in March 2017.
